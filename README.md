## **SITE STRUCTURE**
---

The [BodyMindSoul](https://vivhubb.github.io/body-mind-soul/) website presenting THE FIVE TIBETAN RITES TOUR has three pages: 

* [ABOUT](https://vivhubb.github.io/body-mind-soul/index.html) (which is the default loading page), 

* [ANCIENT MYSTERY & SIGN UP!](https://vivhubb.github.io/body-mind-soul/signup.html) (which displays a short story and sign up form) and 

* [EXERCISE AT HOME](https://vivhubb.github.io/body-mind-soul/athome.html) (which presents and explains the exercises).

[Jump to Top](<#contents>)

---
## **DESIGN**
---

* **TYPEFACE**

The chosen font for the website was Joan, which falls back on serif. Choice was made due to the fonts uppercase version reflecting an antic style and "carved in stone" effect complementing the website's aesthetics togteher with it's lowercase form.

* **COLOUR SCHEME**

The colour scheme choice was partly based on the main page's hero image keeping a common attribute throughout the whole website. Purple, among other things, is associated with mystery. Lighter shades of purple are often used to soothe or calm a viewer. Darker blue and dirty white were used for providing contrast and ease readability.

![responsive snip](/assets/readme.images/responsive.png)

### CODE VALIDATION
---

    THE FIVE TIBETAN RITES TOUR website has been tested with both [W3C Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) and [W3C CSS Validation service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

### BUGS AND FIXES

---
#### **HTML**
---

* ABOUT PAGE

    * test

    ![HTML-CHECK1](/assets/readme.images/html-checker.png)

    * fix

    ![HTML-CHECK1-FIX](/assets/readme.images/html-checker-fix.png)

    Since a heading was not needed in this section, as advised by the validation service, the 'section' element was replaced with a 'div' element instead.

* ANCIENT MYSTERY & SIGN UP PAGE

    * test

    ![HTML-CHECK2](/assets/readme.images/html-checker2.png)

    * fix

    ![HTML-CHECK2-FIX](/assets/readme.images/html-checker2-fix.png)

    This was an oversight which occured while deciding between having separate labels for First Name and Last Name or having just one label for both entries. Label 'for' attribute was amended to match the first text input 'id'.

* EXERCISE AT HOME PAGE

    * test

    ![HTML-CHECK3](/assets/readme.images/html-checker3.png)

* FORM SUBMISSION PAGE

    * test

    ![HTML-CHECK4](/assets/readme.images/html-checker4.png)

---
#### **CSS**
---

* **CSS file**

    * test 01

    ![CSS-CHECK01](/assets/readme.images/CSS%20validation%20errors.1.png)

    * test 02

    ![CSS-CHECK02](/assets/readme.images/CSS%20validation%20errors2.png)

    * fix

    ![CSS-fix](/assets/readme.images/CSS%20validattion%20fix.png)

    The first phase of the validation highlighted that i have used the 'size' property that does not exist and advised for the 'resize' property to be used.
        Once I made the suggested changes and ran the code in the CSS validator again I saw that the issue has not been fixed and I have instantly realized that the property I initially meant to use there was the 'font-size' property.
