## DESIGN
---

* TYPEFACE

The chosen font for the website was Joan, which falls back on serif. Choice was made due to the fonts uppercase version reflecting an antic style and "carved in stone" effect complementing the website's aesthetics togteher with it's lowercase form.

* COLOUR SCHEME

The colour scheme choice was partly based on the main page's hero image keeping a common attribute throughout the whole website. Purple, among other things, is associated with mystery. Lighter shades of purple are often used to soothe or calm a viewer. Darker blue and dirty white were used for providing contrast and ease readability.
