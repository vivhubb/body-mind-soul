            Below you will find all the steps you'll need to complete the exercises correctly as presented and explained

            British Army officer, Colonel Bradford in Peter Kelder's book Ancient Secret of the Fountain of Youth.

            "I suggest that you practice each rite <strong>three times</strong> a day for the <strong>first
                week</strong>.
            Then every week that follows, <strong>increase the daily repetitions by two</strong>, until you are
            performing
            each rite <strong>21 times a day</strong>.
            In other words, the second week, perform each rite five times; the third week, perform each rite seven
            times,
            the fourth week, perform each rite nine times daily, and so on. In ten weeks' time, you'll be doing the full
            number of 21 rites per day."

                "The first rite is a simple one. It is done for the express purpose of speeding up the I vortexes
                Children do it
                all the time when they're playing.
                <br>
                All that you do is stand erect with arms outstretched, horizontal to the floor. Now, spin around until
                you
                become slightly dizzy. One thing is important: you must spin from left to right. In other words, if you
                were to
                put a clock on the floor face-up, you would turn in the same direction as the clock hands. At first,
                most adults
                will be able to spin around only about half a dozen times before becoming quite dizzy. As a beginner,
                you
                shouldn't attempt to do more. And if you feel like sitting or lying down to recover from the dizziness,
                then by
                all means you should do just that. I certainly did at first.
                <br>
                To begin with, practice the rite only to the point of slight dizziness. And with time, as you practice
                all five
                rites, you will be able to spin more and more times with less dizziness."

            <h3 id="rite2">THE SECOND RITE</h3>
            <p>"The third rite should be practiced immediately after rite number two. It too is a very simple one.
                All that you need to do is kneel on the floor with the body erect. The hands should be placed against
                the thigh muscles.
                <br>
                Now, incline the head and neck forward, tucking the chin against the chest. Then, throw the head and
                neck back as far as they will go, and at the same time lean backward, arching the spine. As you arch,
                you will brace your arms and hands against the thighs for support. After arching, return to the original
                position, and start the rite all over again.
                <br>
                As with rite number two, you should establish a rhythmic breathing pattern. Breathe in deeply as you
                arch the spine. Breathe out as you return to an erect position. Deep breathing is most beneficial, so
                take as much air into your lungs as you possibly can.”

            <h3 id="rite4">THE FOURTH RITE</h3>
            <p>"The first time I performed rite number four," said the Colonel, "it seemed very difficult. But after a
                week, it was too as simple to do as any of the others.
                <br>
                First, sit down on the floor with your legs straight out in front of you and your feet about 12 inches
                apart. With the trunk of the body erect, place the palms of your hands on the floor alongside the
                buttocks. Then, tuck the chin forward against the chest.
                Now, drop the head backward as far as it will go. At the same time, raise your body so that the knees
                bend while the arms remain straight. The trunk of the body will be in a straight line with the upper
                legs, horizontal to the floor. And both the arms and lower legs will be straight up and down,
                perpendicular to the floor. Then tense every muscle in the body.
                Finally, relax your muscles as you return to the original sitting position, and rest before repeating
                the procedure.
                <br>
                Again, breathing is important to this rite. Breathe in deeply as you raise up the body. Hold in your
                breath as if you tense the muscles. And breathe out completely as you come down. Continue breathing in
                the same rhythm for as long as you rest between repetitions.”

        <div class="fourth-img">

    <div class="fifth">
        <div class="fifth-text">
            <h3 id="rite5">THE FIFTH RITE</h3>
            <p>"When you perform the fifth rite, your body will be face-down to the floor. It will be supported by the
                hands, palms down against the floor, and the toes in a flexed position. Throughout this rite, the hands
                and feet should each be spaced about two feet apart, and the arms and legs should be kept straight.
                Start with your arms perpendicular to the floor, and the spine arched, so that the body is in a sagging
                position. Now, throw the head back as far as possible. Then, bending at the hips, bring the body up into
                an inverted 'V'. At the same time, bring the chin forward, tucking it against the chest. That's all
                there is to it. Return to the original position and start the rite all over again.
                By the end of the first week, the average person will find this rite one of the easiest to perform. Once
                you become proficient at it, let the body drop from the raised position to a point almost, but not
                quite, touching the floor. Tense the muscles for a moment both at the raised point, and at the low
                point.
                Follow the same deep breathing pattern used in the previous rites. Breathe in deeply as you raise the
                body. Breathe out fully as you lower it.”
