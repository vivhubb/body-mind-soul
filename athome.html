            For everyone who is unable to attend but would be interested to go on their own journey and explore the
            health
            benefits of the Five Tibetan Rites at home.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Below you will find all the steps you'll need to complete the exercises correctly as presented and explained
            by
            British Army officer, Colonel Bradford in Peter Kelder's book Ancient Secret of the Fountain of Youth.

            "I suggest that you practice each rite <strong>three times</strong> a day for the <strong>first
                week</strong>.
            Then every week that follows, <strong>increase the daily repetitions by two</strong>, until you are
            performing
            each rite <strong>21 times a day</strong>.
            In other words, the second week, perform each rite five times; the third week, perform each rite seven
            times,
            the fourth week, perform each rite nine times daily, and so on. In ten weeks' time, you'll be doing the full
            number of 21 rites per day."

            <h3>THE FIRST RITE</h3>
            <p>
                "The first rite is a simple one. It is done for the express purpose of speeding up the I vortexes
                Children do it
                all the time when they're playing.
                <br>
                All that you do is stand erect with arms outstretched, horizontal to the floor. Now, spin around until
                you
                become slightly dizzy. One thing is important: you must spin from left to right. In other words, if you
                were to
                put a clock on the floor face-up, you would turn in the same direction as the clock hands. At first,
                most adults
                will be able to spin around only about half a dozen times before becoming quite dizzy. As a beginner,
                you
                shouldn't attempt to do more. And if you feel like sitting or lying down to recover from the dizziness,
                then by
                all means you should do just that. I certainly did at first.
                <br>
                To begin with, practice the rite only to the point of slight dizziness. And with time, as you practice
                all five
                rites, you will be able to spin more and more times with less dizziness."
